1. What data types do each of these values represent?

    1. "A Clockwork Orange" (string)
    2. 42 (integer)
    3. 09/02/1945 (integer)
    4. 98.7 (float)
    5. $15.99 (integer)



2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

    A case in which a database would be used is if a company needed to store all of
    its subscribers usernames and passwords. A text file would be used if you needed
    to store a relatively short list that wasn't expected to grow (grocery list, etc.)



3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

    SQL is a declarative language, not a procedural language. This means we are only
    concerned about the outcome or result we are looking for, rather than how the
    language finds the result.



4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together
   at a high level.

      Databases store a collection of data types in a table structure with columns
      that define what the data represents and rows that make up a complete conceptual
      unit. Databases have the ability to query and manipulate data using a language
      called SQL. SQL is able to get results from data, update data, and make new
      structures to store data.



5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

    A table structure is the primary way in which databases store data. Tables are made
    up of columns (define what the data represents) and rows (make up a complete conceptual
    unit). Each table cell contains a value (piece of information that the column name
    describes.)



6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

    String, integer, float.



7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following
   queries and include their results:


      SELECT date, amount
      FROM payments;

      This is selecting two columns 'date' and 'amount' from the payments table.
      The result would be:
      Date: 5/1/2016, 5/10/2016, 5/15/2016, 5/23/2016
      Amount: 1500.00, 37.00, 124.93, 54.72


      SELECT amount
      FROM payments
      WHERE amount > 500;

      This is selecting the column 'amount' from the payments table, WHERE
      the amount is greater than $500.
      The result would be:
      Amount: 1500.00



      SELECT *
      FROM payments
      WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

      This is using the special operator to select the entire row from the payments
      table where the payee is equal to 'Mega Foods'.
      The result would be:
        Date        Payee      Amount     Memo
      5/15/2016 - Mega Foods - 124.93 - Groceries





8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and
   include the output:

   -The email and sign-up date for the user named DeAndre Data.

    SELECT email, signup
    FROM users
    WHERE name = 'DeAndre Data';

   -The user ID for the user with email 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'.

   SELECT userid
   FROM users
   WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu';

   -All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

   SELECT *
   FROM users
   WHERE userid = 4;
